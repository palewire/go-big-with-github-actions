# Parallel Actions

This chapter, which Dana will write, will show how to introduce a matrix to your Actions workflow that will run a bunch of scrapers in parallel and then commit the results.

It will gradually build up to:

```yaml
name: Scraper with matrix

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  scrape:
    name: Scrape
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    continue-on-error: true
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        state: [ca, ia, ny]
    steps:
      - name: Hello world
        run: echo "Scraping data for ${{ matrix.state }}"

      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - name: Install scraper
        run: pip install warn-scraper

      - name: Scrape
        run: warn-scraper ${{ matrix.state }} --data-dir ./data/

      - name: upload-artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: ${{ matrix.state }}
          path: ./data/

  commit:
    name: Commit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: scrape
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          pattern: '*'
          path: artifacts/

      - name: Move
        run: |
          mkdir data -p
          mv artifacts/**/*.csv data/

      - name: Commit and push
        run: |
          git config user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git config user.email "actions@users.noreply.github.com"	
          git add ./data/
          git commit -m "Latest data" && git push || true
```
